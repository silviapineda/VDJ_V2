#1. Download IgBlast program and other required files
#IgBlast program can be downloaded from (https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/igblast/release/LATEST ).

#Other required files are also needed. Download the entire directory of internal_data and optional_file from (https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/igblast/release/ ).

#2. Make blast database for germline V, D, and J gene sequences.
#IgBlast allows you to search any germline databases of your choice (using -germline_db_V, -germline_db_J and -germline_db_D options).

#The NCBI mouse germline gene databases (i.e., mouse_gl_V, etc.) are supplied on our ftp site (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/ about database details).

#To search IMGT germline sequences, you need to download them from IMGT web site (http://www.imgt.org/vquest/refseqh.html#VQUEST ). You need to download all V, D and J sequences for whatever organisms you are interested in. Combine all V, all D and all J sequences, respectively, into separate files (i.e., one file for all V sequences, one for all D sequences and one file all for J sequences). After you have downloaded the sequences, invoke our utility tool edit_imgt_file.pl (download from the release/ directory) to process the sequences (to change the long IMGT definition lines to germline gene names only).

#Then you can use NCBIâ€™s makeblastdb tool to make the blast database from the output file. For example:
